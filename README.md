# DII4ET_exercise_naples

In this session, we are going to explore how **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)** combined with **Regression techniques** can be used to build a **Reduced-Order Model (ROM)** for a combustion dataset.  

The exercise will be carried out entirely in Google Colab â€” no local installation is required.  

---

## What to do

Open the notebook ROM_exercise.ipynb directly in Google Colab using the link at the top of the notebook:  
**"Open in Colab"**  

This will launch the notebook in Colab, where you can run all the code step by step.  

---

## What You Will Do

- Load and visualize a combustion dataset  
- Apply POD to extract dominant modes  
- Use regression for reduced-order prediction  
- Animate and interpret results  

--- 

After the hands-on session, the notebook with the solution will be added to this repo.
