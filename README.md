# DII4ET_exercise_naples

In this session, we are going to explore how **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)** combined with **Regression techniques** can be used to build a **Reduced-Order Model (ROM)** for a combustion dataset.  

The exercise will be carried out entirely in **Google Colab** â€” no local installation is required.

## How to Use

1. Open the Colab notebook (link will be provided by the instructor).  
2. Run the notebook step by step:
   - Load and visualize the dataset  
   - Apply POD to extract the dominant modes  
   - Use regression for reduced-order prediction  
   - Visualize and animate the results

## ðŸŽ“ Teaching Purpose

This notebook is part of the **Naples School 2025** program.  
The goal is to give students hands-on experience with:
- Handling a combustion dataset in Python/Colab  
- Applying POD for dimensionality reduction  
- Using regression for reduced-order modeling  

After the hands-on session, a **solution notebook** will be uploaded to this repository.

After the hands-on session, the notebook with the solution will be added to this repo.
